# Citibike Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of Project[^1]
The purpose of the Citibike Bikeshare analysis is to provide potential investors a visualization of the successful bikesharing business in New York City.  Based on the information provided potential investor can determine if they would like to invest or not in a similiar program for Des Moines, Iowa.  The analysis and visualizations will show the following:
1. Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
